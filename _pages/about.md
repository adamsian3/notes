title: About Buster's Notes
---

I'm Buster Benson. I'm currently rebuilding [750words.com](https://750words.com) and recently [wrote a book](https://busterbenson.com/whyareweyelling) about the art of productive disagreement. [Here's some other basic info about who I am](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Buster-Benson--A2GI15IlN2~uk4PY9Wd6lofAAQ-I2Jb6sblUYldUzAc0Qob8). I'm [@buster](https://twitter.com/buster) on Twitter and have my DMs open. You can also <a href="mailto:{{ 'buster@hey.com' | encode_email }}">email me</a> if you're old fashioned like that. 

These are my notes. Basically a collection of links to a small subset of all the things I've written that seem worth keeping around, assorted into [piles](/piles), occassionally [reviewed](/pile/year-in-review) and re-organized into a tower of [beliefs](/codex), standing the test of [time](/life-in-weeks) (for now, at least). My less filtered thoughts and rough notes are [kept in this Dropbox Paper doc](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/An-Amateurs-Unfinished-Map-of-Whatever-Comes-to-Mind-as-This-is-Happening--A2HNuPg0EG_1xq4~gfQtNLYLAQ-IGamgYXatsECbpKVEuBiG).

The current iteration of this website is a [Jekyll static site](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the [minimialist sidey theme](https://github.com/ronv/sidey) hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) via [this Github repo](https://github.com/busterbenson/notes).

This site is the latest incarnation of a personal website that has been morphing into weird shapes since 1998. Here's a version from [2019](https://paused.busterbenson.com/whyareweyelling/), here's one from [a bit before that](http://archive.busterbenson.com). Find even older versions [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140418111024/http://busterbenson.com/), and [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20070104225801/http://bustermcleod.com/), and [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20041215024700/http://erikbenson.com/), and [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20010202090600/http://mockerybird.com/).
