    desc: "Born at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach California. 1976 was the year of the Dragon, Play That Funky Music and Rocky were top of the charts, and Gerald Ford was president. I'm a gemini, which of course doesn't mean anything. My mom collected bicentennial quarters to commemorate my birth year, since it was also the 200th birthday of America."
